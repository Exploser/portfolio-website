*This platform serves as a milestone to my journey in digital art and software development.*

## Features

* Project Showcase: Presentations of web development projects, 3D models and all the other things I am intrested in.

* Custom Art-Work: Almost all the artwork featured on this site, including digital images and design elements, have been personally created by me!  *everything except the character that was generated by AI.*

* Animations: There's a lot of pure css animations in this website,I hope I didn't over used them.
   * *All of the first displayed animations were a part of the amazing [Animate-css](https://github.com/animate-css/animate.css) repo.*
   * All the continuous animations are created by me! 

* Responsive Design: Fully responsive web design ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

## Technologies
